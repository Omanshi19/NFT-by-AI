# NFT by AI 🎨🤖

AI NFT Generator uses Stable Diffusion for prompt-based image creation and mints the generated images as NFTs on Ethereum using React and Solidity smart contracts. This project integrates AI image APIs, Web3 wallet connections, and basic gas optimization, making it a solid intermediate-level Web3 + AI project. [web:96][web:95]

## 🔮 Possible Improvements

- Add gallery view of all minted NFTs for the connected address. [web:91]  
- Add on-chain/off-chain prompt + seed storage for reproducibility. [web:88]  
- Integrate gas estimation and better error handling for failed mints. [web:97]  
- Support multiple networks (Polygon, Base, etc.) via a network selector. [web:91]
