# NFT by AI 🎨🤖

AI NFT Generator uses Stable Diffusion for prompt-based image creation and mints the generated images as NFTs on Ethereum using React and Solidity smart contracts. This project integrates AI image APIs, Web3 wallet connections, and basic gas optimization, making it a solid intermediate-level Web3 + AI project.

## 🚀 Features      

- Prompt-based AI image generation using Stable Diffusion (or compatible image generation API).
- One-click minting of generated images as NFTs on Ethereum.  
- Web3 wallet connection (MetaMask) for signing and sending transactions.
- Basic gas usage optimization and status feedback during minting.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, CSS (or Tailwind/your choice) 
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Hardhat/Truffle for compilation & deployment 
- **Web3:** Ethers.js or Web3.js for blockchain interaction.
- **AI:** Stable Diffusion (via API like Replicate/Hugging Face or your own backend)

## 🔮 Possible Improvements

- Add gallery view of all minted NFTs for the connected address. 
- Add on-chain/off-chain prompt + seed storage for reproducibility. 
- Integrate gas estimation and better error handling for failed mints.  
- Support multiple networks (Polygon, Base, etc.) via a network selector.
